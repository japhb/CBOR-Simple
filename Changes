0.0.8  2021-05-12
  - Partial support for RFC 8746 Typed Arrays tag
    * Common code and constants
    * Packed num arrays, both encode and decode
      (2+ orders of magnitude faster than unpacked Num arrays)
    * Fallback support for encoding intarrays that encodes as standard Arrays
  - Version dependency on TinyFloats


0.0.7  2021-05-02
  - Improve performance in many small (a few %) to medium (2x) ways,
    both for encoding and decoding


0.0.6  2021-04-29
  [Diagnostics]
  - Add cbor-diagnostic($cbor) routine to decode into text diagnostics
  - Add RFC 8949 Appendix A diagnostic tests
